Key Applications for Dementia & Postoperative Care
In the context of dementia and post-surgical recovery, the Beers Criteria emphasize avoiding drugs that can worsen cognitive decline, cause delirium, or increase fall risks. 


  * Antipsychotics: The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) recommends avoiding antipsychotics for behavioral symptoms of dementia unless non-pharmacologic options fail or the patient poses a threat to themselves or others. These drugs carry an increased risk of stroke and mortality in dementia patients.
  * Postoperative Delirium Prevention: Common perioperative medications like benzodiazepines, anticholinergics (e.g., diphenhydramine), and meperidine (Demerol) are strongly linked to increased postoperative delirium. Research indicates that avoiding these PIMs during surgery can lead to significantly better neurocognitive recovery.
  * Anticholinergic Burden: Cumulative exposure to anticholinergic agents—found in many sleep aids and bladder medications—is associated with a higher risk of delirium and the long-term development of dementia.
  * CNS-Active Drugs: Patients should avoid combinations of more than three Central Nervous System (CNS) active drugs (e.g., opioids, antidepressants, or skeletal muscle relaxants) to reduce the risk of falls and fractures. 

Summary of Major 2023 Updates
Medication Category |	2023 Recommendation Summary
Aspirin	            | Avoid for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease due to high bleeding risk.
Rivaroxaban	        | Avoid for long-term treatment of blood clots; other DOACs (like apixaban) are preferred.
Sulfonylureas	      | Avoid all (e.g., glyburide, glipizide) for diabetes due to high risk of severe hypoglycemia.
SGLT2 Inhibitors	  | Use with caution due to risks of dehydration and potential ketoacidosis.

Practical Guidance for Care
Shared Decision-Making: The criteria are not a "never" list; they are a prompt for clinicians to pause and consider safer alternatives.
Alternative Treatments: When a Beers drug is identified, look for evidence-based alternatives or non-pharmacological therapies (e.g., behavioral therapy for dementia).
